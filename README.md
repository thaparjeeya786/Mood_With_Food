# 🍽️ Mood with Food

## 📘 Project Overview
**Mood with Food** is a smart, mood-based food recommendation system that connects human emotions with culinary preferences.  
The project aims to recommend dishes or cuisines based on the user’s **current mood**, helping people make satisfying food choices that align with how they feel.  

Whether we are happy, sad, stressed, or excited — the system intelligently analyzes your mood and suggests meals to uplift or complement your emotional state.  
It provides a personalized and enjoyable experience by blending **machine learning, sentiment analysis, and food recommendation**.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. **Mood Detection** – The system captures user input in the form of text, voice, or image (facial expression).  
2. **Emotion Analysis** – A sentiment analysis or emotion detection model processes the input and classifies the mood (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, Calm, Excited).  
3. **Recommendation Engine** – Based on the detected mood, the system searches a curated dataset or API to suggest relevant dishes or cuisines.  
4. **Display Output** – The recommended food items are displayed on the interface with brief descriptions or recipes.  
5. **User Feedback (Optional)** – The system may collect feedback to enhance future recommendations using machine learning.
